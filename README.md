Presentation files used during my "Perl &amp;&amp; Vim Plugins" talk

Presentation Slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fKc7TaApdE8xlBWjYA1lXm92gj08ojH_uM644VKpkn8/)

All of my vim configuration and other dotfiles can be found on [github.com/neybar/dotfiles](https://github.com/neybar/dotfiles). In particular .vim/plugins.vim is where I've centralized any 3rd party plugins.
